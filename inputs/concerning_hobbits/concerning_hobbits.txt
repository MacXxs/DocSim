The main, pensive variant plays again after Frodo has made ready to leave Bag End, intoning Gandalf's appreciation of Hobbits. It plays in a Lullaby setting when Frodo and Sam, having already taken to the road, set for a night's rest. It returns when Frodo awakes in Rivendell, here often played by the Clarinet to specifically represent Bilbo, with whom Frodo reunites. It returns to the flute when Sam ask to join the quest, and again in Clarinet when he shows concern for Frodo during the cruise of the Anduin. It goes on to close the film with a statement on the tin whistle. In the Two Towers, the theme is used for Sam and Merry's first on-screen appearances, and again in the end of the film when Sam contemplates their story being told. In Return of the King, the clarinet is used when Sam reminds Frodo of Bilbo going "There and Back Again." The more grand B-section only returns when Sam is married to Rosie. The Rural variation doesn't recur until the Hobbits have returned to Hobbiton, where it plays as Sam goes up to Rosie.
